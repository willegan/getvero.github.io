Segments are the name we use for 'lists' of users. Segments give you the ability to name a group of customers.
##1. Creating a segment
To create a segment simply visit the Segments page and select 'New Segment' at the top right.
You will note that there is a default segment created for you, called 'All Users'. This segment lets you email all of your users any time!
Creating a segment has two steps:
1. Giving your segment a name. In this example, we're going to name our segment 'Paying Customers':

2. Select the conditions for that segment. In this instance we're going to define Paying Customers as those customers who have previously purchased a product at least once:
