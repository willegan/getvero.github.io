#What is a Dedicated IP?

A dedicated IP address is a unique internet address dedicated exclusively to a single hosting account. In the case of email this means we'll send your emails from a solo, dedicated server. 

##Should I have a Dedicated IP?

Vero works extremely hard to ensure a consistently high reputation of all our shared IP's.

There are cases however where your situation or volume is best supported by a dedicated IP. This gives you complete control of your own sending reputation – as your reputation will be influenced solely by the quality of your own contacts list and emails.

##How do I get a Dedicated IP?

Once you have Verified your DNS, Vero can assign you domain over to your own dedicated IP.
