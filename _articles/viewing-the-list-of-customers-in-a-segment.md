#Can I view the list of customers in a segment?

You can view your list of customers in a given segment by going to the Segments page and selecting `Edit > View Users` next to any of your segments.

`Edit` appears in the drop down associated with each segment, as below:

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-mainpage-edit['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-mainpage-edit['image'] }})

`View Users` then appears as a blue button in the top right of the segment view:

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-view-users['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-view-users['image'] }})

You can also Export this list for use outside of Vero. To do this select blue `Export` buttons in the top right, whilst on the View Users page. Here's an example:

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-export-users['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.segments-export-users['image'] }})
