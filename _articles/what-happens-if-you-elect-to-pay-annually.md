# What happens if you elect to pay annually?

If you pay annually, we'll give you **two months free.**

We also ensure your email limits are spread out across the year.

As an example, if you are on a plan that gives you up to 175,000 emails per month. On the matching annual plan, you can send up to 2,100,000 emails per year. This means that seasonal spikes in email volume will not be require to upgrade to the next plan up.
