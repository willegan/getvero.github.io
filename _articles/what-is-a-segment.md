# What is a segment?

Segments are one of the key features that give Vero its power.

Unlike many of the more traditional email marketing tools, Vero uses segments in the place of lists. Lists are static groups of customers.

Segments are **dynamic groups** created by filtering your Vero database based on your customers' properties, events, past email interactions and tags. Dynamic lists allow you to set up the segment, and can reduce the amount of work for getting your campaigns out the door on a day-to-day basis.
