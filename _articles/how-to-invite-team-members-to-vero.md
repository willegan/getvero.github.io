#How to invite team members to VeroThe ability to add team members is available on our $149/month and above plans. To learn more, check out Vero's Plans and Pricing.

Administrator’s of a Vero account can add and remove team members.

The original user of a Vero account (the user that signed up) is the default administrator.

By visiting `Account > Team` the administrator can invite team members using the `Invite Team Member` button:

There are three levels of access:

***Administrator**
 – this is only available on the parent (top level) project within Vero. Administrators have full access to all Vero functions and team management.


***Edit / View**
 – this enables the user to both view and edit campaigns.


***View only**
 – this allows users to view logs, campaign statistic reports and copies of email campaigns, but not to make changes or update.

The new user will receive an email from from Vero referencing your account and asking the new user to set a password.

You can revoke access for any team member by selecting `Remove` on the Team management screen.
