# What are tags?

*Note: If you've used other email marketing tools, note that Vero's tags typically hold a different meaning.*

Tags can be used in different situations.

## With campaigns and templates

Vero allows you to tag campaigns and templates to easily sort and find one or multiple object. For example, at Vero, we tagged some campaigns with "Onboarding" and others with "Retention".

## With customers

The main reason for tagging customers is when you want to import a **static list** from another email provider into Vero.

There are multiple way to tag customers: manually, via CSV or via the API

Tags are a power way to enhance segmentation. When you create segments, you can filter customers based on which tags they have and which they don't. This can let you create preference lists, emulate static lists or use Vero as a lightweight CRM.
