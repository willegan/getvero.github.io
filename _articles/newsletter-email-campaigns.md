# What is a newsletter campaign?

A Newsletter is a one-off email. Also known as a manual, email blast, ad-hoc, or promotional message.

Newsletters are different to triggered emails because they are manually scheduled for a specific time (Vero also supports recurring newsletters).

They are considered one-to-many emails, as you are emailing a number of people at once.

In Vero, you define who receives your newsletter using the customer Segments you create.

You could, for example, send a weekly email newsletter to everyone **in the segment** *“Blog Subscribers”* AND who are **not in the segment** *“Paying Customers”* AND they triggered the event of **“has opened”** *any campaign in the last 15 days* OR they have also **"clicked"** *"any campaign in the last 30 days"*.

Segments are very powerful and allow you to get very targeted. Ship the most personalized Newsletters that will resonate with your recipients out the door!
