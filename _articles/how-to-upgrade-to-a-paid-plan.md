#How to upgrade to a paid plan

Once your Vero trial is over, you can upgrade to a paid plan by going to `Account > Subscriptions`.

Simply select your plan, and whether you prefer monthly or yearly billing:

Enter your credit card details and select Save. Your account is now updated.

Yearly billing comes with two free months. You can switch to yearly billing at any time.

After upgrading, you can return the Subscriptions page to see which plan you are currently on, your usage thresholds (email and subscriber limits) and how much of these thresholds you have used.
