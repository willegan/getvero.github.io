# Can I clone an email?

To clone an email in Vero simply select `Clone` from the options menu of the email campaign you'd like to duplicate.

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.clone-email['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.clone-email['image'] }})

After selecting `Clone` you will be asked to confirm your action and have the option to clone from the current project to another project if desired.

Cloning a campaign will copy everything except the result data of the original campaign.
