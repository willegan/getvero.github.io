You can now send your customers one-off emails (also known as newsletters or blast emails) using our newsletter feature.
This is currently in beta so please get in touch to use this feature.
##How to send a newsletter
You can send a newsletter to any segment or combination of segments. 
This means you should first setup some relevant segments. To learn more, refer to our article on 
[how to create a segment](http://www.getvero.com/knowledge-base#/questions/53597-How-do-I-create-a-segment-(BETA)).
Then simply visit the 
[Newsletters](https://www.getvero.com/newsletters) menu and select 'New Newsletter' at the top right.
You can then use our standard campaign builder to create your campaign.
Unlike our behavioral emails, targeting is done by selecting which segments to include or exclude when building your newsletter. Here's a screenshot:

except those in the paying users segment.
