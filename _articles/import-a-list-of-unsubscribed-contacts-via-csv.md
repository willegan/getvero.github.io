#Import a list of unsubscribed contacts via CSV

To learn the full process to import contacts via CSV, read [Import a list of contacts via CSV](http://www.getvero.com/help/adding-data-to-vero/import-a-list-of-contacts-via-csv/).

There are two ways to unsubscribe a list of contacts in Vero:

1. `Copy/Paste`: you can unsubscribe up to 1000 users by copy and pasting their email addresses and checking the `also unsubscribe contacts` box

![{{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-paste['title']}}]({{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-paste.image}})

2. `Import CSV`: If you are importing a significant number of contacts the best way to unsubscribes users is to upload a CSV.

To do this create a CSV with the list of emails you want to unsubscribe in one column and a second column with the header Tags and the word `unsubscribed` in that column.

When you import, all of these customers will be unsubscribed/suppressed forever.

![{{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-import['title']}}]({{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-import.image}})


From here you will receive an email notification when the import is successful (or unsuccessful).
